# ALLMLX â€“ All-Language Linker & Executor

**ALLMLX** is a conceptual next-generation multi-language code runner and LLM-integrated development tool designed to enable seamless integration of 15+ programming languages within a single file. As the proposed successor to [PCL (Python-C Linked)](https://github.com/hejhdiss/pcl), ALLMLX aims to extend the original concept of embedded multi-language programming to support a comprehensive ecosystem of languages, automatic code generation via LLM APIs, and intelligent block linking.

> **Note: This project is currently in the conceptual design phase. The features, syntax, and implementation details described in this README represent the planned vision for ALLMLX and are subject to change during development.**

## Overview

ALLMLX proposes to introduce the `.almlx` file format, which would allow developers to write code blocks in multiple programming languages within a single file. Each block could be linked, imported, and executed together, creating a unified development environment for cross-language prototyping, educational projects, and AI-integrated scripting.

Building upon the foundation of PCL (which enabled Python-C integration with automatic `ctypes` wrapping), ALLMLX is designed to expand support to include Python, C, C++, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Bash, Java, Lua, TypeScript, Ruby, Julia, Kotlin, Swift, and more. Additionally, ALLMLX proposes revolutionary `%llm` blocks that would integrate with AI models to generate code dynamically during the build process.

### Proposed Key Innovations

- **Multi-Language Integration**: Designed to seamlessly combine 15+ programming languages in a single file
- **LLM-Powered Code Generation**: Planned integration with AI models to generate code blocks dynamically
- **Automatic Linking**: Intelligent dependency resolution and cross-language imports
- **Portable Execution**: Proposed single-file bundling with `--onefile` option
- **Extensible Architecture**: Planned plugin-based system for adding new language support

## Proposed Syntax and File Structure

ALLMLX files would use a block-based syntax where each programming language is designated by a specific block identifier:

### Proposed Language Block Types

```
%py         # Python code blocks
%c          # C code blocks  
%cpp        # C++ code blocks
%sh         # Shell/Bash script blocks
%js         # JavaScript code blocks
%rs         # Rust code blocks
%go         # Go code blocks
%java       # Java code blocks
%lua        # Lua code blocks
%ts         # TypeScript code blocks
%rb         # Ruby code blocks
%jl         # Julia code blocks
%kt         # Kotlin code blocks
%swift      # Swift code blocks
%llm        # LLM-generated code blocks
```

### Proposed LLM Block Structure

The planned `%llm` blocks would enable dynamic code generation using various AI APIs:

```
%llm name=<block_name> api_key='<api_key>' api=<provider> model=<model_name> lang=<target_language>
<natural language prompt describing the code to generate>
%endllm
```

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Unique identifier for the generated code block
- `api_key`: Authentication key for the LLM API
- `api`: Provider (openai, groq, local, etc.)
- `model`: Specific model to use (gpt-4, mixtral, etc.)
- `lang`: Target programming language for code generation

### Proposed Block Metadata and Linking

Each block would support metadata for dependency management:

```
%py name=main requires=sort_fn,utils export=result
# Python code here
%endpy

%use llm:sort_fn    # Import code from LLM block named 'sort_fn'
%use c:utils        # Import from C block named 'utils'
```

## Conceptual Example

Here's a conceptual `.almlx` file demonstrating the proposed multi-language integration with LLM code generation:

```almlx
%llm name=sort_fn api_key='sk-xxx' api=groq model=mixtral lang=python
Write a Python function called insertion_sort that takes a list of integers and returns a sorted list using the insertion sort algorithm. Include proper error handling and docstring.
%endllm

%c name=math_utils export=factorial
#include <stdio.h>

long long factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
%endc

%py name=main requires=sort_fn,math_utils
%use llm:sort_fn
%use c:math_utils

import ctypes

def main():
    # Use LLM-generated sorting function
    numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    print("Original array:", numbers)
    
    sorted_numbers = insertion_sort(numbers)
    print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)
    
    # Use C factorial function
    n = 5
    fact_result = math_utils.factorial(n)
    print(f"Factorial of {n}: {fact_result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
%endpy

%sh name=build_logger
#!/bin/bash
echo "Build started at: $(date)"
echo "Building ALLMLX project..."
echo "Languages detected: Python, C, Shell"
echo "LLM blocks: 1"
echo "Build completed at: $(date)"
%endsh
```

## Proposed CLI Commands

ALLMLX would provide a comprehensive command-line interface:

# Run an ALLMLX file
allmlx run /path/to/file.almlx

# Build all blocks and prepare for execution
allmlx build /path/to/file.almlx

# Clean generated artifacts

```

### Planned Advanced Options

```bash
# Create a single-file executable bundle
allmlx run /path/to/file.almlx --onefile

# Build with specific output directory
allmlx build /path/to/file.almlx --output /path/to/build/
